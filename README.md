# Image Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a Python script for encrypting and decrypting images using a simple key-based transformation. The encryption is performed by adding a key to each pixel value, and decryption is achieved by subtracting the same key from each pixel value.

## Features

- Encrypt images by adding a key to pixel values.
- Decrypt images by subtracting the key from pixel values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy
